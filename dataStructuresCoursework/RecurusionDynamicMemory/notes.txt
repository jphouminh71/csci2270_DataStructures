Recursive Functions

Theory:
  A function that calls itself is known as a recursive function. And, this technique is known as , recursion.
  Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self similar way

  This enables the function to repeat itself several times, outputting the result and the end of each iteration.

  The recursion continues until some condition is met to prevent it.

  To prevent infinite recursion, if / else statements (or similar approach), can be used where one branch makes the recursive call and other
  doesn't. so like , if this, return that, or else, do it again.

  Advantages / Disadvantages of Recursive Functions

   Recursion makes program elegant and cleaner, most of the algorithms can be defined recursively which makes it easier to visual and prove.

   If speed of program is vital then, you should AVOID using recursion. Recursion use more memory and are generally slow. Instead just use loops.

   For the most part recursion is slower , and takes up more of the stack as well. The main advantage to recursion is that for problems like tree traversal,
   it makes the algorithm a litter easer or more 'elegant'.

  Self Notes: Its very similar to the process of integration by parts.
