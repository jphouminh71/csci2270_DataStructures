Recursion:
  - The idea is that we keep doing big problems, with small versions of the big problem to solve the big problem
  - Method that calls itself

Algorithm
  IF the problem can be solved directly for the current value of n
  Solve it
  ELSE
    recursively apply the algorithm to one or more problems involving smaller values of n,
    combine the solutions of smaller problems to get the solution to the original problems

    ** the main point is to make sure that the base case will end the recusion



Binary Search
  - Whatever is being Search
    has to have a size
    has to be sorted
  - you can access any element at will

algorithm
  IF the list is empty
    return -1;
  else if, the middle element matches the target
    return the index of the middle element as the result
  else if , the target is less than the middle element
    recursievly search the list elements preceding
      the middle element then return the result
  else,
    recursively search the vector elements following the middle element and return the result
