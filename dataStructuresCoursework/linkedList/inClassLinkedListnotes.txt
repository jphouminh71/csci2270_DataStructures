                                                            Linked Lists
Start every linked list with a HEAD.
- Every linked list node contains some data and then a pointer variable that points to another node that has another piece of data along with either
another address pointing to another node, or an address that is set to NULL.

Example of struct declaration:
struct Data{
  char letter;
  Data *next;     <-- pointer that points to another object of type data
};
