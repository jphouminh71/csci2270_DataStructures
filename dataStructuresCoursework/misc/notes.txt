UNIX Commands
  ls , list all things in the current directory
  ls -l , gives more details about file
  cd , changes the directory,
  mkdri [dir], creates directory
  pwd , tells you where you are in the directory

  terminal compiler command;
  g++ -std=c++11 *filename*
  ./a.out *filename*  <== program ready to compile;

Lecture 1: Basic Algorithms
Cost - we are concerned about our algorithms taking up memory and runtime(cpu runs)
BIG_0 Notation: Big-O is an asymptote notation that defines the upper bound on the growth rate of the algorithmic runtime.
The algorithmic runtime can be characterised as f(n)
  - the letter O is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to sa the order of the function.

Growth Rate: Answers the question, "How does the algorithm scale with the input size"
Ex ) n,n^2,etc.
  Big O essentially sets an upper bound of (x) complexity;

Ex of 1,n and n^2
the following code is fragment from an algorithm that ececutes a constant number of statements thus it is O(1);
code:
  cout << "Learning Big-O";

if the number of executions depend on a variable, then we have a higher than constant growth rate.

code:
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    cout << "Learning big-0"
  }

quadratic complexity
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    for (int j = 1; j < n; j++){
      cout "Learning Big O";
    }
  }                       this is a quadratic growth function

  if there is an algorithm with input reduce by 2 everytime then the complexity becomes logbase(2) and at everystep is reduced by 2

Side notes:
argc = count of arguments given by command line
argv[] = this is the array that keeps all the count of arguments

by default the count of arguments is 1, and the name of the compiled program is argv[0] = ./a.out

POINTERS:
Pointers are pointers are what point to the address of some value(variable) and the dereferencer pushes the pointer into whatever the actual value was
in that specific address.
- dereferencer pushes the pointer at the content, whatever inside the variable.
- stars are to

Pass by value and pass by reference
