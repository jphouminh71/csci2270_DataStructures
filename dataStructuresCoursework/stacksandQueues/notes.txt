Stacks
"First in Last out"
"Last in first out"

Overflow : stack is full and trying to push in another value
** push operation can potentially cause this
Underflow : popping out a value on the stack
** pop operation can potentially cause THIS
** peak can also be the cause of underflow because if you try to peak at an empty list you'll see nothing


stack operations:
isEmpty
isFull
pop
push
peek  == operation to find see what is at the top of the stack


What woudl the stack look like after THIS
stack<int> mystack;
mystack.push(1);
mystack.push(2);
mystack.push(3);
mystack.pop( );
mystack.pop( );
mystack.push(4);
look on phone of picture on this <-- array version

Big O notation of a stack;
array
O(1); if the array is empty   // push and pop
O(1); if we are pushing, we just into the last index; // push and pop

linked list;
adding to the beginning of the linked list, bigO(1);    // push and pop because you are always working from the top or the bottom
